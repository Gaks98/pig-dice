                GAME RULES:

                -The game has 2 player, playing in rounds

                -In each turn, the player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score.

                -BUT, if a player rolls a 1, all his scores in that round get erased. After that, its the next player's turn.

                -The player can choose to "HOLD", which means that the round's score gets added to his previous score. After that, its the other players turn

                -The first player to reach 100 points on his total score, wins
